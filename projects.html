                <p>In fall '23, I teamed up with 3 other students to create an AI for the game Codenames. We started out by scraping words from Wikipedia, Dictionary.com, and Thesaurus.com to generate TFIDF vectors that were used to gauge the similarity of words. After that, we used Minimax and Randomized-Search algorithms to strategically provide clues to the players. This project was made for our Artificial Intelligence class.</p>

                <p>In spring '23, myself, along with 5 other students created a web application that allows users to track their moods and receive songs to complement their moods as well as help track the users' habits. To accompany them on their journey through our application, we also created our Mood Palette mascot, the Moo Pal which users can dress in different outfits. This project was made for our Software Engineering Senior Project class.</p>

Having previously used a template for my website, I took this as an opportunity to not only revamp my website, but dive deep and learn more about HTML and CSS to create the layout that you see here. As for the duck? Just something I like to draw :)</p>
