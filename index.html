											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! My name is Rohan Purandare and I am a student at Purdue University
										working towards getting a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. At Purdue, 
										I am involved in a number of clubs such as the <a href="https://purdueusb.com/" 
										target="_blank"> Purdue Computer Science and Data Science Undergraduate Student Board</a>, <a 
										href="https://boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/launchpad/" target="_blank"> Purdue LaunchPad</a>, and
										<a href="https://boilermake.org/" target="_blank"> BoilerMake</a>.
										In my free time, I love to watch and play soccer, play piano, sing, and solve
										puzzles like the Rubik's cube.

									<h3 class="exp"><strong>Software Development Engineer Intern - <i><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></i></strong></h3>
									<h4 class="exp">Seattle, Washington &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; May 2022 - August 2022</h4>
									<p class="exp"> Over the course of 12 weeks, I worked on an AWS Product called AppStream, specifically on their Photon Ops Console,
										a web-based tool that is used by on-calls to audit and troubleshoot different issues that arise. The current data retrieval 
										process for the Photon Ops Console was working inefficiently as it only stored 3 days worth of data and incurred relatively 
										high costs. I was tasked to create a pipeline that would retrieve data relating to the different streaming instances as well 
										as data logs directly from the data base. I did this by querying the search parameters from the user in the database, filtering 
										the data to remove irrelevant information, and then reformatting and returning the data so that it would be displayed properly.

									<h3 class="exp"><strong>Course Lead/Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CS 193: Tools - <i>Purdue University</i></strong></h3>
									<h4 class="exp">West Lafayette, IN &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; August 2021 - Present</h4>
									<p class="exp"> Initially starting this position as an Undergradutate Teaching Assistant, I graded homework, held office hours
										as well as held Practice/Study/Observation sessions where I would answer any questions that students had and helped them with
										whatever they were working on. Since, January 2022, I accepted the role to be the instructor for this course where I teach students
										(approximately 700 students per year), the basics of git, terminal, and various programming techniques to help them create a strong
										foundation for programming in their later years at Purdue. In addition to this, I also deal with communicating and hiring the
										Undergraduate Teaching Assistants for this class.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3 class="exp"><strong>Software Development Intern - <i><a href="https://www.ptc.com/" target="_blank">PTC</a></i></strong></h3>
									<h4 class="exp">Boston, MA &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; June 2021 - August 2021</h4>
									<p class="exp"> Over the course of a ten-week long period, I interned with the PTC's Creo team. Over here, I specifically 
										worked with their collaboration service team, who are responsible for allowing users to collaborate on the same 3D 
										modeling document in Creo. My job was to automate the API Specification as it was previously written by hand. I 
										incorporated a third-party tool called go-swagger and modified the code and wrote an external program to allow 
										go-swagger to parse through the code and generate an API Spec. From here, I utilized another third-party tool called
										swagger2openapi to convert the API Spec from Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0.0
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3 class="exp"><strong>Private Tutor</strong></h3>
									<h4 class="exp">Lexington, MA &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; August 2019 - Present</h4>
									<p class="exp"> I have been privately teaching middle school kids computer science and math. 
										Even though they started out with no prior computer science knowledge, I was able to teach them the fundamentals 
										and was able to help them create projects like connect-four and various ciphers. With math, I either help them with
										their homework or I teach them material that is related to the content they learn at school. Since I am able to 
										tutor these kids one-on-one, I create a lesson plan that is geared to each of their capabilities and needs. This has
										been an incredibly rewarding experience as I have been able to witness first-hand how much more confidence these kids 
										have gained in computer science and math. I also really value every interaction I have with my students because I 
										learn how to become a better teacher.
