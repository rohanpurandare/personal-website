                    <h3>West Coast - One Republic</h3>
                    <p> Starting the year off with a really cool song, one of my favorite things about West Coast is it's chord progression and how it 
                        accompanies the melody of the chorus. Upon hearing it for the first time, it gives a sort of positive mysterious vibe that draws
                        you in, but the way it does this is pretty neat. The chorus is broken down into two parts where each line gets repeated. The first
                        two lines ("I've been dreaming about the West Coast" and "Found some places that I don't know") plays around with the root note
                        (a note that typically gives a sense of comfort) and the minor third note (a note that typically gives an uneasy feeling). So, for
                        the first line, they accompany the melody with a chord that places an emphasis on the root note and then for the second line, they
                        play a chord that emphasizes the minor third which creates that slightly uneasy feeling. In the second half of the chorus ("Give me
                        the sun for just a year" and "I'll kiss the sky and disappear"), they do something really similar. This time, the melody focuses on
                        the minor sixth (another note that gives an uneasy fealing) and the perfect fifth (a note that gives a comforting feeling). However,
                        this time they swap the chords to first play the slightly uneasy one and then resolve the chorus with a more comforting chord to
                        drive home the sense of positivity in their otherwise mysterious sounding chorus. Aside from that, I think the vocals on this song
                        are great -- the lead vocalist does an amazing job switching between his chest voice and falsetto which is rather difficult.

            <h2>BoilerMake XI</h2>
            <p>This past weekend (1/19 - 1/21), I directed BoilerMake XI, Purdue's largest hackathon along with the rest of the BoilerMake executive team. 
                Being 36 hours long, there were several components of the event that we needed to plan such as application logistics, the mini-events that
                occurred throughout, swag, judging formats, and more. Though brainstorming ideas for the different components was a lot of fun, it became 
                challenging to ensure that everything would be feasible and within the budget. Fortunately, I was working with such a wonderful and talented 
                group of people that BoilerMake meetings became something that I really looked forward to. In addition to this, the executive team played 
                an integral to make sure that the hackathon ran as smoothly as it did. Even though we ran into a few hiccups during the event, we were able 
                to quickly pivot and figure out workarounds to ensure that our hackers and sponsors had a great time at BoilerMake XI. Ultimately, we were 
                proud to have hosted around 350 hackers who created about 70 fascinating projects along with 10 companies who generously sponsored our event.
