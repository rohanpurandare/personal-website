            <h2>BoilerMake XI</h2>
            <p>This past weekend (1/19 - 1/21), I directed BoilerMake XI, Purdue's largest hackathon along with the rest of the BoilerMake executive team. 
                Being 36 hours long, there were several components of the event that we needed to plan such as application logistics, the mini-events that
                occurred throughout, swag, judging formats, and more. Though brainstorming ideas for the different components was a lot of fun, it became 
                challenging to ensure that everything would be feasible and within the budget. Fortunately, I was working with such a wonderful and talented 
                group of people that BoilerMake meetings became something that I really looked forward to. In addition to this, the executive team played 
                an integral to make sure that the hackathon ran as smoothly as it did. Even though we ran into a few hiccups during the event, we were able 
                to quickly pivot and figure out workarounds to ensure that our hackers and sponsors had a great time at BoilerMake XI. Ultimately, we were 
                proud to have hosted around 350 hackers who created about 70 fascinating projects along with 10 companies who generously sponsored our event.
