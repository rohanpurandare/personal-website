                    <h3>Are You Bored Yet? (feat. Clairo) - Wallows, Clairo</h3>
                    <p> In the midst of all of the chaos of from school work, I found myself playing this song quite a
                        bit as it was pretty calming. With its playful melody and strong chord foundation, you can't help
                        but bop your head to the rhythm of the song. Throughout the song, you hear background vocals an
                        octave higher that I feel really complement the lead singer well and also create a good transition 
                        to the next verse. Another really cool detail that was added is that in the chorus, the lead singers
                        and the instrumentals create a sort of round where the instrumentals accompany the singers in the 
                        latter half of the chorus by playing the melody of the former half of the chorus. By having so much 
                        familiarity of the song sprinkled throughout in the accompaniment, you get a nice sense of peace.

                    <h3>Till Forever Falls Apart - Ashe, FINNEAS</h3>
                    <p> Yet another song that I heard for the first time this month! I had never really heard 
                        of Ashe, and heard only a few songs by FINNEAS, but this quickly became one of my favorite 
                        songs for the month. It is a pretty uplifting song talking about how their love will persist 
                        even if everything collapses. This song has a nice back and forth initially with the two artists 
                        and I really like how while similar the background is somewhat different for the two. When we 
                        hear Ashe sing, it seems a bit more playful and simple, however, when FINNEAS sings, it seems 
                        a bit more intense with a steady drum line. My favorite part of the song though is by far and 
                        away the bridge. I find it really fascinating that even though they sing different melodies with 
                        different rhythms, they still work with one another.

                    <h3>Angels Like You - Miley Cyrus</h3>
                    <p> Miley Cyrus has such a unique voice and I feel as though this song highlights all of 
                        these characteristics really well. This song starts out pretty similarly to Kill Bill 
                        (June '23 Song of the Month) in that it has gradual ups and downs, but then as we get 
                        to the last line of each verse, you can hear the delicate and precise riff (<i>"when it 
                        feels right"</i>, <i>"close your eyes"</i>) that leads us to the chorus. To juxtapose something 
                        so careful as this with the powerful emphasis on each note really showcases Miley Cyrus's
                        versatility. But that is not my favorite part. As mentioned, the chorus starts off pretty
                        strong, however, line by line, it seems as though Miley Cyrus just keeps taking it up a
                        notch. With this, you can hear the slight change tone in her voice as it becomes a bit more
                        raspy which I feel perfectly captures the mood of the song.

                    <h3>Beverly Blues - Opia</h3>
                    <p>Funny enough, I heard this song for the first time after listening to the Spotify radio 
                        album of Downward (July song of the month). I'll be honest, this song takes a couple 
                        seconds to get used to, but once you understand the rhythmic pattern and how the tune 
                        is incorporated into it, you can't help but bop your head to the beat. One really unique 
                        thing about this song that I love is that typically, the rhythm of the melody that is 
                        sung is dictated by the drum line. However, in this song, the lyrics throughout the 
                        entire song are specifically chosen to and emphasized in certain ways to add an extra 
                        layer of percussion (also seen briefly in Golden Hour by JVKE and Don't by Ed Sheeran).</p>

                    <p>I had never heard of Ripe before July and only heard them from listening to radios on Spotify, but I started to really like their music, with Downward being my favorite. I really love how this song explores different rhythmic patterns. Starting off with a simple guitar tune and slowly building up, I think what made me fall in love with this song was the sudden contrast to a staccato rhythm in the prechorus. It really caught me off guard as it seemed like the genre suddenly changed, but I feel like it added a whole other dimension to the overal song. It then returns to the same pattern as the chorus, but this time, the percussion is syncopated (on the off beat) which I thought was pretty cool.</p>

It is a rather simple song with not too much accompaniment, but what I find really like about this song is the chorus. Again, nothing too complex, but the melody follows a pattern of steadily becoming higher before falling back down. It's a bit tricky to describe, but this pattern sways you back and forth almost making you feel a bit dizzy - something which I've never seen with any other song.</p>

However, after I listened to In The Stars a few times - enough to loosly sing along to - I noticed how beautifully this song was written. As a tribute to his late grandmother, Boone details vivid memories with her and how he is coping with losing her. It quickly became one of my favorite songs as the lyrics are complemented wonderfully with a rather simple accompaniment to emphasize his message.</p>
