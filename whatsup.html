                    <h3>In The Stars - Benson Boone</h3>
                    <p>When listening to music, I tend to focus more on the tune and rhythm of a song rather than the actual lyrics. However, after I listened to In The Stars a few times - enough to loosly sing along to - I noticed how beautifully this song was written. As a tribute to his late grandmother, Boone details vivid memories with her and how he is coping with losing her. It quickly became one of my favorite songs as the lyrics are complemented wonderfully with a rather simple accompaniment to emphasize his message.</p>
