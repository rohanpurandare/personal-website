								<h2>What I'm Involved In</h2>
								<p>At Purdue, I am involved in a number of different clubs which allow me to meet new people and form
                                friendships, as well as learn and work towards things that I am interested in.
                                </p>
                                <p><a href="https://purdueusb.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Purdue Computer Science and Data Science Student Board
                                </a>: </strong> As a member of Purdue USB, I am able to work with a group of 25 other CS/DS students to improve 
                                the computer science and data science departments at Purdue. We have several initiatives that help students in 
                                different ways, such as teaching them about the fundamental tools required in computer science and data science, 
                                providing a list of tutors available, holding student forums to allow students to voice their issues, and more.
                                </p>
                                <p><a href="https://boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/launchpad/" target="_blank"><strong>LaunchPad</a>:</strong>
                                Initially starting out in the club as a mentee, I am now the Advertising and Communications Lead of this club. LaunchPad allows freshmen in
                                computer science and data science to create a technical project that they came up with by pairing them with a mentor. As an
                                organizer of the club, I am responsible for interviewing potential mentors and mentees as well as arranging various
                                events for the mentors and mentees.

                                largest computer science clubs, Purdue Hackers enables students to participate around the country and hosts several
                                events and workshops throughout the year for computer science and data science students. In Purdue Hackers, I am part
                                of the logistics team which is responsible for organizing these events and contacting companies to sponsor, attend, and
                                feature.</p>

                                </strong> Adapted Toys for Children, ATC, is a nonprofit club that recieves childrens toys and works to redesign them
                                such that they are far easier to use for children with disabilities before donating them. In ATC, I am part of the 
                                3-D printing team which is working to design bigger buttons which are simpler to press compared the ones that are 
                                typically built in.

                                <h2>My Background</h2>
								<p>I am a 19 year old computer scientist from Lexington, Massachusetts. I first got into computer
                                science in the tenth grade and have been fascinated by it since. Aside from CS, I am a massive soccer
                                fan and take every opportunity to play and watch my favorite team play. Additionally, I am very fond of
                                music and enjoy disecting the various components that go into the creation of every song. I love
                                playing the piano and guitar, singing, and beatboxing. I also like to keep myself busy by tackling puzzles
                                such as the Rubik's cube or play games like minesweeper. 
                                </p>
