								<h2>What I'm Involved In</h2>
								<p>At Purdue, I am involved in a number of different clubs which allow me to meet new people and form
                                friendships, as well as learn and work towards things that I am interested in.
                                </p>
                                <p><a href="https://purdueusb.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Purdue Computer Science and Data Science Student Board
                                </a>: </strong> As the Vice President of Purdue USB, I am able to work with a group of 25 other CS/DS students to improve 
                                the computer science and data science departments at Purdue. We have several initiatives that help students in 
                                different ways, such as teaching them about the fundamental tools required in computer science and data science, 
                                providing a list of tutors available, holding student forums to allow students to voice their issues, and more.

                                <p><a href="https://boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/launchpad/" target="_blank"><strong>LaunchPad</a>:</strong>
                                Initially starting out in the club as a mentee, I am now the Advertising and Communications Lead of this club. LaunchPad allows freshmen in
                                computer science and data science to create a technical project that they came up with by pairing them with a mentor. As an
                                organizer of the club, I am responsible for interviewing potential mentors and mentees as well as arranging various
                                events for the mentors and mentees.

				BoilerMake enables students to work on a project, meet new people, and have a good time over the course of 36 hours. Within

                                <h2>My Background</h2>
								<p>I am a 19 year old computer scientist from Lexington, Massachusetts. I first got into computer
                                science in the tenth grade and have been fascinated by it since. Aside from CS, I am a massive soccer
                                fan and take every opportunity to play and watch my favorite team play. Additionally, I am very fond of
                                music and enjoy disecting the various components that go into the creation of every song. I love
                                playing the piano and guitar, singing, and beatboxing. I also like to keep myself busy by tackling puzzles
                                such as the Rubik's cube or play games like minesweeper. 
                                </p>
